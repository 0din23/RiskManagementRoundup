Topic Monte Carlo

- Redo risk calculations using a Monte Carlo Sim instead of a historical one.

Questions

-> Choice of Distribution
-- Maybe do a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
-- Simple Gausian Process
-- ARMA-GARCH

-> Compare Results to historical and filtered simulation
-- How good is it in the backtest
-- Are the risk figures significantly different

-> Do we have to modify our earlier statement about crypto assets? (Which one?)
